I decided to build both my portolio and its own backend in order to become proficent in terms of full stack web development. You can check either on my Github profile. I've used node.js, express.js and mongodb to create an efficient as well as simple web application which is able to manage requests/response in terms of actions such as visitor's contacts storing, links to older projects, resume and microsoft 365 templates deploying and other features.
